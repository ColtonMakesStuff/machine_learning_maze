# Machine Learning Maze

This repository showcases a simple yet engaging project demonstrating the principles of SARSA reinforcement learning through a customizable maze navigation challenge. It features a visually intuitive interface and adjustable settings, making it a valuable tool for both learning and entertainment.

## Key Features:

- Interactive maze environment: Users can guide an agent through a maze using arrow keys, observing its learning process in real-time.
- Configurable complexity: Define maze size and adjust difficulty to explore different learning scenarios.
- Visual representation: Canvas-based rendering provides a clear understanding of the agent's navigation and decision-making.
- Reinforcement learning implementation: Experience the power of SARSA by observing the agent learn through exploration, rewards, and penalties.

## Responsibilities:

- Game design: Created the core maze navigation mechanics and interactive features.
- Machine learning algorithm implementation: Adapted and integrated the SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm to guide the agent's decision-making.

## Tools & Languages:

- JavaScript 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
